# FIGHTBOAT
10 boats enter. Fewer leave.

Learning Dart by writing a simple clone of a popular boat battle game.

Currently, this is a command line application. It's not playable yet, but getting pretty close to being able to go through a game flow on one machine (i.e. not exactly playable for two players keeping their boards secret).

I'd like to add an opponent to play against in single player games.
